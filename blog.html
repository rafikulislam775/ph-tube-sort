            First of all, we use var, let, and const for defining variables that
            contain the values!!

        <h1 class="text-3xl">What is scope of variable in JavaScript?</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript variables have only two scopes. Global Variables A global
          variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in
          your JavaScript code. Local Variables A local variable will be visible
          only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are
          always local to that function.

            <h2 class="card-title">Scope of var</h2>
            <p>
              Variables declared with var have function or global scope. This
              means they are accessible throughout the entire function or even
              globally if declared outside of any function. Let's take a closer
              look at the scope of var with an example:
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card w-96 bg-base-100 shadow-xl object-cover">

              src="./logo/let.png"
              class="rounded-xl h-52 w-full object-cover object-center"
              alt="var"
            />
          </figure>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">Scope of let</h2>
            <p>
              Variables declared with let have block scope. This means they are
              only accessible within the block where they are defined, which
              could be a loop, a conditional statement, or any code enclosed
              within curly braces.

              class="rounded-xl h-52 w-full object-cover object-center"

          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">Scope of const</h2>
            <p>
              Variables declared with const have block scope, similar to let.
              They are only accessible within the block where they are defined.
              However, const variables come with an additional constraint: their
              value cannot be reassigned after initial assignment.

          Understanding the Use Cases of null and undefined in JavaScript
        </h1>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, both null and undefined are special values used to
          indicate the absence or unavailability of a meaningful value in
          variables. However, they serve slightly different purposes and have
          specific use cases.

      <div class="flex items-center justify-center">

          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">null</h2>
            <p>
              null is typically used when you want to explicitly indicate that a
              variable should have no value or should be empty.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card flex-1 bg-base-100 shadow-xl">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">undefined</h2>
            <p>
              undefined is often automatically assigned to a variable in
              JavaScript under certain circumstances. It indicates that a
              variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value or that a
              value is absent.

        <p>
          A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer
          Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural
          principles and conventions for designing web services. It is not a
          protocol or standard but rather a style of building web applications
          and services. <br />
          <br />
          REST APIs provide also a standardized way for clients (such as web
          browsers or mobile apps) to communicate with servers over the
          internet. They are essential for building scalable, maintainable, and
          interoperable web services that can be easily integrated into various
          applications and platforms.
